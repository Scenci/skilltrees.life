# skilltrees.life

## The Development
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). 
This project also leverages [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for many of the visuals elements.

This application was built using a combination of modern best practices and janky implementations by myself and assistance from ChatGPT-4.

## The Reason
This project was started as a way to learn, progress and ultimately demonstrate my ability to create reactive UI with React and NextJS. This project was created primary in an effort to continue my education in web development.

## The Concept
skilltrees.life is meant to be a place where people can learn what it takes to specialize into a profession or skill as you would specialize into a skill tree in a RPG.
